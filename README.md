# CodeAlpha_Fibonnacci generator.

This repository contains fibonacci generator simple but yet interesting.I have built it using basics of python.
Fibonnaci series is a special series in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, defined by a mathematical recurrence relationship.

It was fun to make and i urge you all to see it and try it.

share your feedback to make it even better! Let's level up together in the world of coding! ðŸ’»âœ¨
